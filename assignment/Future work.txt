Although the results are fairly good just above 70%, the models could be improved further with more
pre-processing steps to prepare the data for testing. Deep learning algorithms can be implemented 
alongside machine learning algorithms to compare the performance between them. This research can 
provide useful insights for US Airline Corporations by giving information about customerâ€™s 
sentiment to the respective airlines.
