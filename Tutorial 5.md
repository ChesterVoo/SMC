Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
- fined grained opinion mining, to determine the sentiment of a text with respect to a specific aspect. Traditional SA methods treat a text as a whole and assign it to a 
single sentiment label (e.g positive,neutral,negative) , imagine receiving 5 stars for service but food was poor. Aspect Based SA is better suited for situations like this,
where we can target specific aspect.
